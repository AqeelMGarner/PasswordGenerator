# PasswordGenerator

## Description

My motivation for making this application was to create a simple password generator using my recently learned skills in Javascript. The reason why i built this application was to show my understanding of intermediate Javascript and create something that can be useful in everyday life. The problem my application solves is to create a password at a click of a button which is a universal password for all requirements. What i learned in building this application was to use new Javascript skills such as functions and methods to make my code more readable.
